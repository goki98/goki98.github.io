Hello :)
I am Gokhula Prasad, a PhD scholar at the National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli (NIT-T), working in the field of high energy physics with a primary focus on dark matter phenomenology. My research explores the production  of bound state  dark matter  and  detection techinuques . In near future, I want to explore  including its impact on the cosmic microwave background, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and admixing of dark matter inside compact obejcts such as neutron stars. 

Beyond research, I am passionate about photography, with a particular interest in spontaneous everyday moments, macro photography, and capturing animal life. Apart from photography, I am also a big fan of reading many novels and this has led me to start my own novel
